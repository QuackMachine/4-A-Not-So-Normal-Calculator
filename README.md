# 4-A-Not-So-Normal-Calculator
Making a not-so-normal calculator, this was meant for a joke? I got bored.

This idea came up when I was dicussing with a friend about making
a calculator that only gives out the wrong answer.
I should've went more in depth in this.
Probably come back in the future to add more shenanigans.
